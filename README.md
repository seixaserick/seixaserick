- 👋 Hi, I am Erick, a brazilian senior web developer and software architect with over 27 years of non-stop programming.
- 👀 I'm interested in sharing my knowledge to help other programmers and also being helped when I see difficult paths in the way.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning NFC, ERC tokens (smart contracts implementations), different types of ORMs, automated test tools, Flutter and DART.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on back-end projects (.NET Core or .NET 5.0+), SQL Server or Postgres issues and some WebRTC projects (screensharing and videoconferences).
- 📫 You can reach me by email <seixaserick77@gmail.com> for remote job opportunities (preffered part time by contract) or for technical issues that you need some help. Feel free to connect with me through Linkedin <https://www.linkedin.com/in/seixaserick> too.
